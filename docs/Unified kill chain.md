\# Unified Kill Chain – Blue Team Detection \& Response Playbook



This repository demonstrates my hands-on understanding of the Unified Kill Chain from a blue team and SOC analyst perspective. It documents how cyber attacks progress across each phase and how defenders can detect, investigate, and respond using SIEM concepts, log analysis, and incident response workflows.



\## Objectives

\- Map attacker behavior to Unified Kill Chain stages

\- Demonstrate SOC-style detection and triage thinking

\- Practice documentation and incident reporting

\- Showcase defensive security skills for internships and junior SOC roles



\## Skills Demonstrated

\- Threat detection logic

\- Log analysis fundamentals

\- Incident response workflow

\- Security documentation

\- Blue team methodology



\## Learning Sources

\- TryHackMe – Unified Kill Chain

\- SOC and Blue Team training labs
