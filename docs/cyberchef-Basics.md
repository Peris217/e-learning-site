\# CyberChef Basics



\## Overview

CyberChef is a web-based tool used in cybersecurity to decode, analyze, and transform data safely. It is often described as a Swiss Army knife for data because it provides many operations in one interface.



\## Why CyberChef Matters

In defensive security and SOC environments, analysts often encounter encoded, obfuscated, or suspicious data. CyberChef allows analysts to inspect and transform this data without executing it, reducing risk.



\## Key Concepts Learned

\- Input: Raw data such as encoded strings or suspicious text

\- Operations: Individual tools like Base64 decoding, XOR, and hashing

\- Recipes: A sequence of operations applied in order to process data



\## Example Use Case

A Base64-encoded string was decoded using a simple CyberChef recipe to reveal readable text. This demonstrates how CyberChef can quickly make hidden data understandable.



\## Skills Gained

\- Data decoding and transformation

\- Understanding of common encoding techniques

\- Building and applying CyberChef recipes

\- Defensive security investigation mindset
