\# SOC Fundamentals



\## Introduction



This document covers the fundamentals of a Security Operations Center (SOC).

It is part of my defensive security learning and focuses on how security

monitoring, logs, and detection tools are used to identify, analyze, and

respond to security incidents.



The purpose of this documentation is to build a clear understanding of how

SOC operations work in practice, not just to define concepts. It explains how

different security tools and data sources connect and how a SOC analyst

reasons when investigating alerts.

\## What is a SOC?



A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team responsible for

continuously monitoring systems, networks, and endpoints to detect and

respond to security threats.



The SOC operates on a 24/7 basis and acts as the first line of defense

against cyber attacks. Its main responsibilities include monitoring security

events, analyzing alerts, responding to incidents, and escalating serious

threats when required.

\## SOC Analyst (Level 1)



A SOC Level 1 analyst is responsible for initial alert monitoring and triage.

This role focuses on identifying potential security incidents and deciding

whether they require further investigation or escalation.



Typical responsibilities of a SOC Level 1 analyst include:

\- Monitoring alerts generated by security tools

\- Reviewing and analyzing logs from multiple sources

\- Identifying false positives versus real security issues

\- Documenting findings and actions taken

\- Escalating confirmed incidents to higher-level analysts

\## Logs in SOC Operations



Logs are records of events generated by systems, applications, endpoints,

and network devices. They provide visibility into what happened, when it

happened, and where it happened.



In a SOC environment, logs are essential because they form the foundation

of detection and investigation. Analysts rely on logs to reconstruct events,

identify suspicious behavior, and understand the scope of an incident.

\## Firewall



A firewall is a security control that monitors and filters network traffic

based on predefined rules. It determines which traffic is allowed and which

traffic is blocked.



Firewalls generate logs that show allowed and denied connections. These logs

are important for identifying suspicious network activity, such as repeated

blocked connection attempts or unexpected inbound traffic.



However, a firewall only controls network access and does not provide

visibility into what happens inside a system after access is granted.

\## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)



Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) focuses on monitoring activity on

endpoints such as workstations and servers. Endpoints are considered critical

because they execute code and are common targets for attackers.



EDR tools monitor processes, file activity, user behavior, and system changes.

They are designed to detect suspicious or malicious behavior and can respond

by isolating systems, stopping processes, or alerting analysts.



EDR provides visibility that network-based tools cannot see.

\## SIEM / CM (Security Monitoring)



Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), accessed through CM tools in

this learning environment, is used to collect, normalize, and correlate logs

from multiple sources.



SIEM helps SOC analysts by bringing together data from firewalls, endpoints,

servers, and applications into a single view. This correlation allows analysts

to identify patterns that would not be visible when reviewing logs in isolation.



---



\## How SOC Tools Work Together



SOC tools do not work independently. Effective detection relies on combining

multiple data sources.



For example:

\- A firewall may block suspicious inbound traffic and generate a log

\- An endpoint may show unusual process activity through EDR

\- These events are collected and correlated in SIEM / CM

\- A SOC analyst reviews the alert, analyzes the context, and determines the

&nbsp; appropriate response



This layered approach improves detection accuracy and reduces the chance of

missing attacks.

\## Purpose of This Documentation



This document serves as a foundational reference for SOC fundamentals and

defensive security concepts. As my learning progresses, this documentation

will be expanded with deeper explanations, examples, and practical analysis

based on hands-on experience.
