\# Incident Response Fundamentals



\## Introduction

Incident Response (IR) is the structured approach used to manage and respond to cybersecurity incidents such as malware infections, unauthorized access, and data breaches.



The goal of incident response is to minimize damage, reduce recovery time, and prevent future incidents.





\## What Is a Security Incident?

A security incident is any event that threatens:

\- Confidentiality

\- Integrity

\- Availability



Examples include:

\- Malware infections

\- Phishing attacks

\- Unauthorized system access

\- Data breaches







\## Incident Response Lifecycle

Most organizations follow a structured incident response lifecycle.



\### 1. Preparation

This phase focuses on readiness.

Includes:

\- Security policies and procedures

\- Logging and monitoring

\- Incident response plans

\- Training and awareness



Good preparation reduces impact when incidents occur.







\### 2. Identification

The goal is to detect and confirm an incident.

Activities include:

\- Reviewing logs and alerts

\- Monitoring IDS/IPS and SIEM tools

\- Identifying abnormal behavior



Accurate identification prevents false positives and delays.







\### 3. Containment

Containment limits the spread of the incident.

Examples:

\- Isolating infected systems

\- Blocking malicious IP addresses

\- Disabling compromised accounts



Containment can be short-term or long-term.







\### 4. Eradication

This phase removes the root cause.

Examples:

\- Removing malware

\- Closing exploited vulnerabilities

\- Applying patches

\- Resetting compromised credentials



Eradication ensures the threat is fully eliminated.







\### 5. Recovery

Systems are restored to normal operation.

Includes:

\- Restoring from clean backups

\- Monitoring systems closely

\- Verifying services are functioning properly



Recovery must be done carefully to avoid reinfection.







\### 6. Lessons Learned

After the incident:

\- Document what happened

\- Analyze response effectiveness

\- Improve controls and procedures



This phase strengthens future security posture.







\## Role of Logs in Incident Response

Logs are critical throughout the incident response process.

They help:

\- Build an attack timeline

\- Identify affected systems

\- Determine attacker actions

\- Support reporting and compliance







\## Conclusion

Incident response is a core cybersecurity function.  

Understanding the incident lifecycle and the role of logs enables effective detection, containment, and recovery.



These fundamentals are essential for junior cybersecurity and SOC roles.
