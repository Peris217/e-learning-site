\# Vulnerability Scanner Overview



\## Introduction

A vulnerability scanner is a security tool used to identify weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications.  

These weaknesses can be exploited by attackers if not properly addressed.



Vulnerability scanning is a key activity in vulnerability management and risk reduction.







\## What Is a Vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a flaw or weakness that can be exploited to:

\- Gain unauthorized access

\- Execute malicious code

\- Disrupt system availability

\- Compromise sensitive data



Vulnerabilities may exist due to:

\- Misconfigurations

\- Missing patches

\- Weak credentials

\- Software bugs







\## What Is a Vulnerability Scanner?

A vulnerability scanner automatically scans targets to:

\- Detect known vulnerabilities

\- Identify misconfigurations

\- Assess security posture



Scanners compare systems against databases of known vulnerabilities such as CVEs.







\## Common Types of Vulnerability Scans



\### 1. Network-Based Scans

Scan networks to identify:

\- Open ports

\- Running services

\- Exposed systems



Used to detect external attack surfaces.







\### 2. Host-Based Scans

Scan individual systems to identify:

\- Missing patches

\- Weak configurations

\- Local vulnerabilities



Provide deeper visibility than network scans.







\### 3. Application Scans

Focus on applications, especially web applications.

Used to detect:

\- SQL injection

\- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

\- Insecure authentication







\## Vulnerability Scanning Process



\### 1. Asset Discovery

Identify systems and applications to scan.







\### 2. Scanning

The scanner probes targets to detect vulnerabilities.







\### 3. Analysis

Results are analyzed to:

\- Validate findings

\- Identify false positives

\- Assess severity







\### 4. Remediation

Vulnerabilities are addressed by:

\- Applying patches

\- Fixing configurations

\- Updating software







\### 5. Re-Scanning

Systems are scanned again to confirm remediation.







\## Severity Levels

Vulnerabilities are commonly rated as:

\- Low

\- Medium

\- High

\- Critical



Severity helps prioritize remediation efforts.







\## Role of Vulnerability Scanning in Security

Vulnerability scanners help organizations:

\- Reduce attack surface

\- Prevent breaches

\- Meet compliance requirements

\- Improve overall security posture





\## Limitations of Vulnerability Scanners

Vulnerability scanners:

\- Cannot detect all vulnerabilities

\- May generate false positives

\- Do not replace manual testing



They should be combined with other security practices.







\## Conclusion

Vulnerability scanning is a fundamental cybersecurity practice.  

Understanding how scanners work and how to interpret results is essential for junior cybersecurity roles.



Regular scanning and remediation significantly reduce security risks.
