\# Log Fundamentals



\## Introduction

Logs are records of events generated by systems, applications, and network devices.  

They are essential in cybersecurity for monitoring activity, detecting threats, and investigating incidents.



Understanding logs is a core skill for security analysts and incident responders.







\## What Is a Log?

A log is a time-stamped record that shows:

\- What happened

\- When it happened

\- Where it happened

\- Who or what triggered the event



Logs help answer critical security questions during investigations.







\## Common Types of Logs



\### 1. System Logs

Generated by operating systems.

Examples:

\- System startup and shutdown

\- Hardware errors

\- User login/logout activity



Used to detect:

\- Unauthorized access

\- System failures

\- Privilege abuse







\### 2. Application Logs

Generated by applications and services.

Examples:

\- Web server access logs

\- Database query logs

\- Application errors



Used to detect:

\- Application misuse

\- Injection attacks

\- Unexpected crashes

\### 3. Security Logs

Focused on security-related events.

Examples:

\- Failed login attempts

\- Account lockouts

\- Permission changes



Used to detect:

\- Brute-force attacks

\- Insider threats

\- Policy violations



---



\### 4. Network Logs

Generated by network devices.

Examples:

\- Firewall logs

\- Router and switch logs

\- IDS/IPS alerts



Used to detect:

\- Suspicious traffic

\- Port scanning

\- Malware communication



---



\## Key Elements of a Log Entry

Most logs contain:

\- Timestamp

\- Source (IP address, hostname, application)

\- Event description

\- Severity level (info, warning, error)



Understanding these fields helps analysts quickly identify threats.

\## Why Logs Are Important in Cybersecurity

Logs help security teams to:

\- Detect attacks early

\- Investigate incidents

\- Meet compliance requirements

\- Understand system behavior



Without logs, incident response becomes guesswork.







\## Logs in Incident Response

During an incident, logs are used to:

\- Identify the attack timeline

\- Determine affected systems

\- Find the root cause

\- Support recovery and reporting







\## Conclusion

Log analysis is a foundational cybersecurity skill.  

Strong understanding of logs enables effective monitoring, detection, and incident response.



This knowledge is critical for junior cybersecurity roles and security operations teams.
